Okay, so this guy over here, should make decisions on whether to show a notification or show directly on screen

Here's how it works. Its supposed to be a singleton. Meaning, if its class is loaded, it's only instance should be accessible

If app comes live, will tell the available instance that its active. If not, will be destroyed with Broadcast receiver
once it finishes its task. Hope this logic works!!!!!!!

    Very important var. Used to tell us if fragment is active or not, thus registered itself to this singleton

    Will not be gc'd since reference extends to frag. If frag deregisters, sets val to null, and say, BroadcastReceiver
    destroyed, so can be gc'd. If frag get it first, BroadcastReceiver should not get another instance but rather this
    single one to push its updates to, and this controllerRegistered value will tell us if to push a notif or not

    Not an activity, so should not bring an exception of some sort. Just raw code, with a clever twist

    AND IT WOOORKED. IT WOORRKEDDD!! DANG!! NO DOCS ON HOW I COULD HAVE BroadcastReceiver and Foreground app talk.
    I might have just made the first architecture, using a singleton as some sort of pipe/socket, thanks to the
    singleton's single instance design constraint. DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG!!!ðŸ’ª
